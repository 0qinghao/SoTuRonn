  abstract   = {Transforms used in image coding are also commonly used to compress prediction residuals in video coding. Prediction residuals have different spatial characteristics from images, and it is useful to develop transforms that are adapted to prediction residuals. In this paper, we explore the differences between the characteristics of images and motion compensated prediction residuals by analyzing their local anisotropic characteristics and develop transforms adapted to the local anisotropic characteristics of these residuals. The analysis indicates that many regions of motion compensated prediction residuals have 1-D anisotropic characteristics and we propose to use 1-D directional transforms for these regions. We present experimental results with one example set of such transforms within the H.264/AVC codec and the results indicate that the proposed transforms can improve the compression efficiency of motion compensated prediction residuals over conventional transforms.},

It consists of both camera captured content and computer generated content such as text and graphics. These two types of content have different properties requiring different processing and compression techniques. However, it is often required to compress such content with standard video coding solutions. In this paper a low-cost solution for improved screen content coding based on the upcoming video coding standard HEVC is presented. It includes specific intra and inter coding solutions that skip some of the common video coding methods, in this case transforms, enhancing the compression of screen content. Additional signalling and signal-level adjustment methods are introduced. Savings of up to 30\% of the bit-rate are observed for intra coding and up to 25\% for inter coding of screen content. Modest gains of up to 3\% are observed for content that consists of both camera captured content and graphics.},

  abstract   = {Cross-component linear model (CCLM) for chroma intra-prediction is a promising coding tool in the joint exploration model (JEM) developed by the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET). CCLM assumes a linear correlation between the luma and chroma components in a coding block. With this assumption, the chroma components can be predicted by the linear model (LM) mode, which utilizes the reconstructed neighboring samples to derive parameters of a linear model by linear regression. This paper presents three new methods to further improve the coding efficiency of CCLM. First, we introduce a multi-model CCLM (MM-CCLM) approach, which applies more than one linear model to a coding block. With MM-CCLM, reconstructed neighboring luma and chroma samples of the current block are classified into several groups, and a particular set of linear model parameters is derived for each group. The reconstructed luma samples of the current block are also classified to predict the associated chroma samples with the corresponding linear model. Second, we propose a multi-filter CCLM (MF-CCLM) technique, which allows the encoder to select the optimal down-sampling filter for the luma component with the 4:2:0 color format. Third, we present an LM-angular prediction method, which synthesizes the angular intra-prediction and the MM-CCLM intra-prediction into a new chroma intra-coding mode. Simulation results show that the BD-rate savings of 0.55\%, 4.66\%, and 5.08\% on average for Y, Cb, and Cr components, respectively, are achieved in all intra-configurations with the proposed three methods. MM-CCLM and MF-CCLM have been adopted into the JEM by JVET.},

However, they have concentrated only on fitting the empirical data from some standard pictures with a variety of well-known statistical distributions, and then comparing their goodness of fit. The Laplacian distribution is the dominant choice balancing simplicity of the model and fidelity to the empirical data. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no mathematical justification as to what gives rise to this distribution. We offer a rigorous mathematical analysis using a doubly stochastic model of the images, which not only provides the theoretical explanations necessary, but also leads to insights about various other observations from the literature. This model also allows us to investigate how certain changes in the image statistics could affect the DCT coefficient distributions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a DCT/DST based transform scheme that applies either the conventional DCT or type-7 DST for all the video-coding intra-prediction modes: vertical, horizontal, and oblique. Our approach is applicable to any block-based intra prediction scheme in a codec that employs transforms along the horizontal and vertical direction separably. Previously, Han, Saxena, and Rose showed that for the intra-predicted residuals of horizontal and vertical modes, the DST is the optimal transform with performance close to the KLT. Here, we prove that this is indeed the case for the other oblique modes. The optimal choice of using DCT or DST is based on intra-prediction modes and requires no additional signaling information or rate-distortion search. The DCT/DST scheme presented in this paper was adopted in the HEVC standardization in March 2011. Further simplifications, especially to reduce implementation complexity, which remove the mode-dependency between DCT and DST, and simply always use DST for the 4 \texttimes{} 4 intra luma blocks, were adopted in the HEVC standard in July 2012. Simulation results conducted for the DCT/DST algorithm are shown in the reference software for the ongoing HEVC standardization. Our results show that the DCT/DST scheme provides significant BD-rate improvement over the conventional DCT based scheme for intra prediction in video sequences.},

  abstract = {Traditional intra prediction usually utilizes the nearest reference line to generate the predicted block when considering strong spatial correlation. However, this kind of single-line-based method does not always work well due to at least two issues. One is the incoherence caused by the signal noise or the texture of other objects, where this texture deviates from the inherent texture of the current block. The other reason is that the nearest reference line usually has worse reconstruction quality in block-based video coding. Due to these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient multiple-line-based intra-prediction scheme to improve coding efficiency. Besides the nearest reference line, further reference lines are also utilized. The further reference lines with a relatively higher quality can provide potentially better prediction. At the same time, the residue compensation is introduced to calibrate the prediction of boundary regions in a block when we utilize further reference lines. To speed up the encoding process, this paper designs several fast algorithms. The experimental results show that compared with HM-16.9, the proposed fast search method achieves a 2.0\% bit saving on average and up to 3.7\% by increasing the encoding time by 112\%.},

For this reason, the proposed network has the potential to generate better prediction. In addition, the proposed network has good generalization ability on different bitrate settings. The model trained from a specified bitrate setting also works well on other bitrate settings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Enhancing image compression quality and ratio was achieved through several approaches such as neural networks and discrete transforms. However, other heuristic and bio-inspired methods such as genetic algorithms are still under experimentation. In this paper, we introduced a new image compression mechanism based on exploiting the relationship between fractional numbers and their corresponding quotient representation. Each sub-image is mapped to a fractional number based on the RGB representation, and then reduced to an efficient quotient. The appeal of using genetic algorithms is explained by the massive search to find a close fraction that is reduced to short quotient. Our method showed a considerable compression ratio when the least significant bits of each byte are altered, hence, the image quality is preserved while achieving high compression ratio.},

  abstract = {In the last 17 years, since the finalization of the first version of the now-dominant H.264/Moving Picture Experts Group-4 (MPEG-4) Advanced Video Coding (AVC) standard in 2003, two major new generations of video coding standards have been developed. These include the standards known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and Versatile Video Coding (VVC). HEVC was finalized in 2013, repeating the ten-year cycle time set by its predecessor and providing about 50\% bit-rate reduction over AVC. The cycle was shortened by three years for the VVC project, which was finalized in July 2020, yet again achieving about a 50\% bit-rate reduction over its predecessor (HEVC). This article summarizes these developments in video coding standardization after AVC. It especially focuses on providing an overview of the first version of VVC, including comparisons against HEVC. Besides further advances in hybrid video compression, as in previous development cycles, the broad versatility of the application domain that is highlighted in the title of VVC is explained. Included in VVC is the support for a wide range of applications beyond the typical standard- and high-definition camera-captured content codings, including features to support computer-generated/screen content, high dynamic range content, multilayer and multiview coding, and support for immersive media such as 360\textdegree{} video.},

It has been developed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET), consisting of ITU-T Study Group 16 Question 6 (known as VCEG) and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 (known as MPEG). VVC has been designed to achieve significantly improved compression capability compared to previous standards such as HEVC, and at the same time to be highly versatile for effective use in a broadened range of applications. Some key application areas for the use of VVC particularly include ultra-high-definition video (e.g. 4K or 8K resolution), video with a high dynamic range and wide colour gamut (e.g., with transfer characteristics specified in Rec. ITU-R BT.2100), and video for immersive media applications such as 360\textdegree{} omnidirectional video, in addition to the applications that have commonly been addressed by prior video coding standards. Important design criteria for VVC have been low computational complexity on the decoder side and friendliness for parallelization on various algorithmic levels. VVC is planned to be finalized by July 2020 and is expected to enter the market very soon.The tutorial details the video layer coding tools specified in VVC and develops the concepts behind the selected design choices. While many tools or variants thereof have been available before, the VVC design reveals many improvements compared to previous standards which result in compression gain and implementation friendliness. Furthermore, new tools such as the Adaptive Loop Filter, or Matrix-based Intra Prediction have been adopted which contribute significantly to the overall performance. The high-level syntax of VVC has been re-designed compared to previous standards such as HEVC, in order to enable dynamic sub-picture access as well as major scalability features already in version 1 of the specification.},

Based on the relationships among the various types of DCTs, we can generally factor any DCTs into lifting steps and additions and then get four types of integer DCTs, which need no float-point multiplications. By combining the polynomial transform and the one-dimensional (1-D) integer cosine transform, a two-dimensional (2-D) integer discrete cosine transform is proposed. The proposed transform needs only integer operations and shifts. Furthermore, it is nonseparable and requires a far fewer number of operations than that used by the corresponding row-column 2-D integer discrete cosine transform.},

  abstract   = {Lossy compression is the main target of the upcoming video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC). However, lossless coding is supported in VVC by utilizing a certain encoder configuration. Particularly, the Transform Skip Mode (TSM) is always selected at the block level to bypass the transform stage (together with a QP that results in the same output as input at the quantization stage). Consequently, the Intra Subpartition (ISP) coding mode cannot be used for lossless coding, considering that its combination with TSM is not supported in VVC because it does not provide a significant coding benefit for the lossy common test conditions. For this reason, it is proposed to enable such a combination for the benefit of lossless coding. Besides, the encoder search has been optimized to improve the trade-off between compression benefit and encoder run-time. Experimental results show a 0.71\% coding gain with a corresponding encoder run-time of 111\%.},

Bit stream is generated by multiplexing various frequency components with run-level coding combined with Huffman coding. The proposed system also includes a new bit rate control algorithm that could significantly improve image quality consistency in one frame.

It is conceived as a "low complexity projection" of the universal context modeling paradigm, matching its modeling unit to a simple coding unit. By combining simplicity with the compression potential of context models, the algorithm "enjoys the best of both worlds." It is based on a simple fixed context model, which approaches the capability of the more complex universal techniques for capturing high-order dependencies. The model is tuned for efficient performance in conjunction with an extended family of Golomb (1966) type codes, which are adaptively chosen, and an embedded alphabet extension for coding of low-entropy image regions. LOCO-I attains compression ratios similar or superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art schemes based on arithmetic coding. Moreover, it is within a few percentage points of the best available compression ratios, at a much lower complexity level. We discuss the principles underlying the design of LOCO-I, and its standardization into JPEC-LS.},

  abstract = {Video coding standards are primarily designed for efficient lossy compression, but it is also desirable to support efficient lossless compression within video coding standards using small modifications to the lossy coding architecture. A simple approach is to skip transform and quantization, and simply entropy code the prediction residual. However, this approach is inefficient at compression. A more efficient and popular approach is to skip transform and quantization but also process the residual block in some modes with differential pulse code modulation (DPCM), along the horizontal or vertical direction, prior to entropy coding. This paper explores an alternative approach based on processing the residual block with integer-to-integer (i2i) transforms. I2i transforms can map integer pixels to integer transform coefficients without increasing the dynamic range and can be used for lossless compression. We focus on lossless intra coding and develop novel i2i approximations of the odd type-3 discrete sine transform (ODST-3). Experimental results with the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) reference software show that when the developed i2i approximations of the ODST-3 are used along the DPCM method of HEVC, an average 2.7\% improvement of lossless intra frame compression efficiency is achieved over HEVC version 2, which uses only the DPCM method, without a significant increase in computational complexity.},

  abstract   = {The lossless intra-prediction coding modality of the High Efficiency Video Coding standard provides high coding performance while allowing frame-by-frame basis access to the coded data. This is of interest in many professional applications, such as medical imaging, automotive vision, and digital preservation in libraries and archives. Various improvements to lossless intra-prediction coding have been proposed recently, most of them based on sample-wise prediction using differential pulse code modulation (DPCM). Other recent proposals aim at further reducing the energy of intra-predicted residual blocks. However, the energy reduction achieved is frequently minimal due to the difficulty of correctly predicting the sign and magnitude of residual values. In this paper, we pursue a novel approach to this energy-reduction problem using piecewise mapping (pwm) functions. In particular, we analyze the range of values in residual blocks and apply accordingly a pwm function to map specific residual values to unique lower values. We encode the appropriate parameters associated with the pwm functions at the encoder, so that the corresponding inverse pwm functions at the decoder can map values back to the same residual values. These residual values are then used to reconstruct the original signal. This mapping is, therefore, reversible and introduces no losses. We evaluate the pwm functions on 4 \texttimes{} 4 residual blocks computed after DPCM-based prediction for lossless coding of a variety of camera-captured and screen content sequences. Evaluation results show that the pwm functions can attain the maximum bitrate reductions of 5.54\% and 28.33\% for screen content material compared with DPCM-based and block-wise intra-prediction, respectively. Compared with intra-block copy, piecewise mapping can attain the maximum bit-rate reductions of 11.48\% for a camera-captured material.},

Compared to the HEVC nonlossless coding mode with the smallest quantization parameter value (i.e., 0 for 8-b video and -12 for 10-b video), the HEVC lossless coding mode provides perfect fidelity and an average bit-rate reduction of 3.2\%-13.2\%. It also significantly outperforms the existing lossless compression solutions, such as JPEG2000 and JPEG-LS for images as well as 7-Zip and WinRAR for data archiving. To further improve the coding efficiency of the HEVC lossless mode, a sample-based angular intra prediction (SAP) method is presented. The SAP employs the same prediction mode signaling method and the sample interpolation method as the HEVC block-based angular prediction, but uses adjacent neighbors for better intra prediction accuracy and performs prediction sample by sample. The experimental results reveal that the SAP provides an additional bit-rate reduction of 1.8\%-11.8\% on top of the HEVC lossless coding mode.},

We are particularly interested in improving the lossless compression efficiency of the intra coding process for grayscale anatomical medical images. We focus on intra coding due to its low complexity and outstanding compression results, as well as the fact that it allows coding high-dimensional medical images on a slice-by-slice basis. This is especially advantageous for cases when only a small set of slices needs to be accessed without the need to decode the entire data set. Based on the characteristics of grayscale anatomical medical images, specifically their large amount of edge information and frequent number of patterns depicted on various directions, we propose improvements to HEVC intra coding based on sample-by-sample (SbS) differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) with equal displacements so the density of prediction modes is constant in all directions. Performance evaluations over MRI, CT and X-ray angiography sequences show that the proposed improvements outperform current HEVC lossless intra coding, achieving average coding gains of 6\%.},

In this paper we investigate and improve the recently introduced Sample-based Weighted Prediction (SWP) for HEVC lossless coding. Although being very efficient for natural video content, the SWP algorithm can be further improved for screen content by using a directional template predictor in cases where the SWP algorithm yields worse prediction.

  abstract   = {While the next generation video compression standard, Versatile Video Coding (VVC), provides a superior compression efficiency, its computational complexity dramatically increases. This paper thoroughly analyzes this complexity for both encoder and decoder of VVC Test Model 6, by quantifying the complexity break-down for each coding tool and measuring the complexity and memory requirements for VVC encoding/decoding. These extensive analyses are performed for six video sequences of 720p, 1080p, and 2160p, under Low-Delay (LD), Random-Access (RA), and All-Intra (AI) conditions (a total of 320 encoding/decoding). Results indicate that the VVC encoder and decoder are 5\texttimes{} and 1.5\texttimes{} more complex compared to HEVC in LD, and 31\texttimes{} and 1.8\texttimes{} in AI, respectively. Detailed analysis of coding tools reveals that in LD on average, motion estimation tools with 53\%, transformation and quantization with 22\%, and entropy coding with 7\% dominate the encoding complexity. In decoding, loop filters with 30\%, motion compensation with 20\%, and entropy decoding with 16\%, are the most complex modules. Moreover, the required memory bandwidth for VVC encoding/decoding are measured through memory profiling, which are 30\texttimes{} and 3\texttimes{} of HEVC. The reported results and insights are a guide for future research and implementations of energy-efficient VVC encoder/decoder.},

The most recent video-coding standard from JCT-VC, named High Efficiency Video Coding, greatly improved the compression rate compared to its predecessor, H.264/AVC, but an even better performance must be pursued to accommodate future technologies. This article presents a comparison between the current state-of-art HEVC standard with the most recent project that is being conducted by the same group of experts, entitled Versatile Video Coding (VVC). According to experimental results obtained using similar configurations for both encoders, the VVC reference software provides significant bit-rate savings of 44.4\% on average when compared to HEVC. However, this compression gains come with high computational costs: the VVC encoding time is on average 10.2 times higher when SIMD are used, and 15.9 times higher without such optimizations.},

Nine source sequences were carefully selected to offer both diversity and representativeness, and different resolution versions were encoded by all three codecs at pre-defined target bitrates. The compression efficiency of the three codecs are evaluated using two commonly used objective quality metrics, PSNR and VMAF. The subjective quality of their reconstructed content is also evaluated through psychophysical experiments. Furthermore, HEVC and AV1 are compared within a dynamic optimization framework (convex hull rate-distortion optimization) across resolutions with a wider bitrate, using both objective and subjective evaluations. Finally the computational complexities of three tested codecs are compared. The subjective assessments indicate that, for the tested versions there is no significant difference between AV1 and HM, while the tested VTM version shows significant enhancements. The selected source sequences, compressed video content and associated subjective data are available online, offering a resource for compression performance evaluation and objective video quality assessment.},
